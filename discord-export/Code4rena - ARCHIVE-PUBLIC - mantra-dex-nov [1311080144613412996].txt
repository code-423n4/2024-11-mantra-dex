👋 Hello and welcome to the** $60,000 in USDC MANTRA DEX** audit channel!

📆 Audit opens Friday, 29 November 2024 (20:00 UTC) and runs through Monday, 13 January 2025 (20:00 UTC) (45 days).

Please give a warm welcome to the MANTRA team, particularly @Delroy, @jvr0x, and @mantra_man , who will be available for questions either here in the channel or via a PRIVATE thread. You can expect them to be available in Europe & Asia time zones. 

🤖 **Documentation bot assistance:** For general questions about the codebase, give our documentation bot a try, by tagging `@Docs Wolf` in any thread (private or public) and asking your question. The bot will make its best attempt to answer based on the codebase and documentation, and link you to relevant resources.  *Docs Wolf will be available when the audit is live.*

We'll be posting relevant links, documentation, etc. here, so if you intend to participate in this audit, consider enabling notifications for this channel. 🐺 ⏰

ℹ️ Wardens, FYI we've added @jvr0x, Mantra's SC engineer, to the list of sponsor team members to tag in private threads if you have questions about the codebase.

Hey @CloudEllie @Delroy @jvr0x I have a question about the acceptability of the bugs, For example if a Bug Explicitly Exists in the smart contract but due to the customized and application-specific logic of mantra chain that bug becomes invalid in on-chain execution, what would happen in that case? since some or most of the researchers auditing CosmWasm based Smart Contracts may not be familiar with the GO implementation of Cosmos SDK in customized chains


[12/16/2024 11:24] jvr0x
If you consider you found a bug taking the chain logic into consideration feel free to raise the bug

@🐺Wardens  Since this audit includes live code, a reminder about [Code4rena's "live criticals" policy](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/incentive-model-and-awards#the-live-criticals-exception), which outlines how C4 handles disclosures of critical/high-severity bugs in deployed code.

- The code in scope for this audit is mantra-dex 1.0.0
- Release history: https://github.com/MANTRA-Chain/mantra-dex/releases

the test files are in scope as well right?


[01/06/2025 15:04] cloudellie (pinned)
@🐺Wardens follow-up to my previous post about "live criticals" and deployed code: 

- **Not all code in the audit repo is currently deployed.** Only findings affecting deployed/live code should be submitted as sensitive disclosures.
- The deployments are listed in the docs: https://docs.mantrachain.io/mantra-smart-contracts/mantra_dex/deployments
- Right now, **only the pool manager and fee collector are live,** although the farm manager and epoch manager code is expected to be final and ready to deploy.

Apologies for the @-spam but wanted to make sure all participating wardens have shared context! Thank you all for your diligence in surfacing potentially sensitive issues via the proper method. 🙏

Hey, I submitted my tax information, but the web page does not reflect anything. Is this intended?


[02/13/2025 09:12] cloudellie
It can take a week or so to review the info. But the important thing for timelines is that you submitted in time.
